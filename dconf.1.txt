NAME
----
dconf - create a system's hardware and software configuration snapshot


SYNOPSIS
--------
dconf [-q] [-v] [-c config] [-o output]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Dconf is a tool to collect a system's hardware and software configuration.
It allows to take your system configuration with you on the road, compare
identical systems (like nodes in a cluster) to troubleshoot HW or SW
problems.

Dconf is also useful in projects where you have to manage changes as a
team. Dconf can run periodically and send out system changes to a list
of email addresses so that they can be revised and discussed in group.

You can customize your dconf configuration for specific needs, like making
a profile of your laptop's hardware or copy specific software configuration
files to send out or compare with other systems.

As a sysadmin, you won't become too paranoid if less experienced people
have root-access. As a consultant, you won't feel isolated if you don't
have remote access to your systems. As a support engineer, you won't
become frustrated if a customer has fiddled around with some important
config file and you have to find which. As a performance tuner, you can
capture the state of the system configuration in between performance
tests/benchmarks.


OPTIONS
-------
-c, --config file::
	specify alternative configfile

-o, --output file::
	write output to given file

-q, --quiet::
	minimal output

-v, --verbose::
	increase verbosity

-vv, -vvv::
	increase verbosity more


ARGUMENTS
---------
Man:::
	Ah. I'd like to have an argument, please.
Receptionist:::
	Certainly sir. Have you been here before?
Man:::
	No, I haven't, this is my first time.
Receptionist:::
	I see. Well, do you want to have just one argument, or were
	you thinking of taking a course?
Man:::
	Well, what is the cost?
Receptionist:::
	Well, It's one pound for a five minute argument, but only
	eight pounds for a course of ten.
Man:::
	Well, I think it would be best if I perhaps started off with
	just the one and then see how it goes.

USAGE
-----
To create a snapshot of the current system:::
.....
dconf
.....

To check the latest changes against the previous snapshot:::
.....
zdiff -u /var/log/dconf/dconf-$HOSTNAME-previous.log.gz /var/log/dconf/dconf-$HOSTNAME-latest.log.gz
.....


ADDING FILES OR COMMANDS
------------------------
You can add files and commands to /etc/dconf-custom.conf and include
that from your /etc/dconf.conf, however I would appreciate if you send
me any changes you make so that they can be include in the next version.

Dconf was design so that an excessive list of configuration files or
commands would not harm the execution of the program or the content of
the snapshot file.

Please send changes to: Dag Wieers mailto:dag@wieers.com[]
