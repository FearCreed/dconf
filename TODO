### Usability
+ Check against RPM database (if inside and not changed, leave it out)
+ Make mailing diffs smart (keep the headers and diff content)
+ Add support for (recursive) dirs
+ Currently dconf fails if email is specified but mailserver is not working

### Output
+ Sort the different sections
+ Allow XML or HTML output (in some way)

### Query tool (dconf-diff)
+ Add tool to smart diff between 2 dates (say: dconf-diff '1 day ago')
+ Add tool to restore files from dconf log
+ Get logged-on people directly from utmp database (based on given dates)
