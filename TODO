### Configuration (help welcome !)
+ Add as many config files and important system state info
+ Add Mandriva/Gentoo/... config files

### Usability
+ Make mailing diffs smart (keep the headers and diff content)
+ Add support for (recursive) dirs (dirs = )
+ Rotate snapshots or consolidate snapshots (by removing in-between snapshots)
+ Add dpkg support
+ Use the same order in the snapshot file as the order of the sections

### Output
+ Allow XML or HTML output (in some way)

### Query tool (dconf-diff)
+ Add tool to smart diff between 2 dates (say: dconf-diff '1 day ago' or dconf-diff 'now')
+ Get logged-on people directly from utmp database (based on given dates), see python-utmp

### Restore tool (dconf-restore)
+ Add tool to restore files from dconf log (say: dconf-restore --root /tmp /etc/sysctl.conf)

### Bugs
+ Dconf needs a very recent python (2.3) with unified_diff support (for email-functionality only)
+ sysctl actually performs a change and this goes against the intent, sadly sysctl -a returns random/variable stuff -> false positive
+ netstat is disabled since it often shows different output -> false postive
