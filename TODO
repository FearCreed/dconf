### Configuration
+ Add as many config files and important system state info
+ Split Conectiva/Debian/Mandrake/Red Hat/SuSE config files

### Usability
+ Make mailing diffs smart (keep the headers and diff content)
+ Add support for (recursive) dirs
+ Rotate snapshots or consolidate snapshots (by removing in-between snapshots)
+ Add dpkg support

### Output
+ Sort the different sections
+ Allow XML or HTML output (in some way)

### Query tool (dconf-diff)
+ Add tool to smart diff between 2 dates (say: dconf-diff '1 day ago')
+ Add tool to restore files from dconf log
+ Get logged-on people directly from utmp database (based on given dates)

### Bugs
+ Dconf needs a very recent python with unified_diff support
+ Dconf should not fail if RPM is missing
+ Dconf should not try and cat files it has not permission to read
